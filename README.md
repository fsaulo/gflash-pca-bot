## Visual computing application using PCA

------

Experimental bot that plays guitar flash (not yet). It uses Principal Component Analysis on screen-shots being taken at very low frame rate to detect the notes as it moves through the stage. 
That kind of analysis is not necessary, perhaps extremely redundant for this application, nevertheless it proves a point.
